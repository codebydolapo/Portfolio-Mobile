## TO Get Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

It is the git repository of my personal portfolio website, and has been in a constant state of improvement since mid-2022.



It is built using Next-JS, TypeScript and Tailwind, among other frameworks and technologies.
